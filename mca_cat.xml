    <inm:scopecontent>Collection consists of the Rush University Office of Student Affairs&apos; newsletter &quot;Rush Reporter&quot; which was produced for the student body from 1977 to 1999. Each year, approximately eight issues were published, though this varies. Numbering of volume and issue is irregular throughout. The newsletter provided student news, information on loans, scholarships, and jobs; a recurring feature, &quot;Inside the Student Counseling Center,&quot; which offered tips to students; recurring features by the Student Bookstore and the Rush University Library; pictures taken at student events (usually unidentified); and advertisements for student activities and outings.  Some supplementary materials such as mock-ups, special summer issues, and drafts are included in the collection.  Included are &quot;Rush Press,&quot; a precursor to &quot;Rush Reporter,&quot; 1975; &quot;New Students F. Y. I.,&quot; 1987; &quot;The Rush Informer,&quot; 1987; drafts and related correspondence related to a column for &quot;Rush Reporter&quot; on nursing history by Ruth Johnsen, [1982?]; &quot;Rush University Orientation&quot; and &quot;Orientation News,&quot; 1990-1992; &quot;Rush Reporter,&quot; new student edition, 1996; &quot;Rush Reporter,&quot; material posted on University intranet site, 1998-1999.
