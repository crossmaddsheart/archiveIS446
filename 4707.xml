<inm:adminbiohist>Rush Medical College, 1837-1942, was founded by physician Daniel Brainard (1812-1866) and chartered 2 March 1837, three days before the city of Chicago received its own charter.  Brainard, a New York native educated in Pennsylvania, found his way to Chicago and opened a private practice.  Although it was developing rapidly, Chicago was still very much a frontier town.  Brainard saw a need for a medical school that could train men from throughout the Midwest in the latest standards of medicine.  He named this new school Rush Medical College after the respected physician Benjamin Rush (1745-1813), a signer of the Declaration of Independence.  Because of financial difficulties, the school was not opened until 1843.  In 1844, a college building was erected at the corner of Dearborn Avenue and Indiana Street (now Grand Avenue).  In 1867, a larger building was erected to replace it.  However, this building was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.  After the fire, the school was re-located to the west side of the city, where it remains to this day.  In 1875, a Clinical Building was erected at the corner of Wood and Harrison Streets, and in 1893, a Laboratory Building was erected on the south side of Harrison Street, opposite the Clinical Building.  The Senn Building, adjoining the Clinical Building on the east, was dedicated in 1902.  In 1887, the College became the medical department of Lake Forest University.  This relation was dissolved by mutual consent in April 1898, and in the same month an affiliation with the University of Chicago was established.  In 1883, Presbyterian Hospital, adjoining the college, was established in affiliation with RMC, and the Daniel A. Jones Memorial Building was erected to house the new hospital.  In May 1924, a new contract was executed between the Rush Medical College and the University  of Chicago, and Rush became more of an integral part of the University.  The old Clinical Building was replaced by the Rawson Building that same year.  Rush was affiliated with other institutions over the years, including the Children’s Memorial Hospital, the Home for Destitute Crippled Children, and the Country Home for Convalescent Children.  From 1843 to 1942, Rush Medical College graduated almost 11,000 physicians.

In 1941, Rush Medical College and the University of Chicago terminated their relationship, and Rush became affiliated with the University of Illinois.  Rush closed its doors, and its faculty remained on the staff at the University of Illinois.  Rush’s charter remained active and the corporation still owned its land and buildings.  Rush’s trustees continued to meet, mostly to discuss financial issues.  The trustees kept the Rush name alive in a few ways, approving the Rush Department of Biochemistry of Presbyterian Hospital, establishing Rush Research Associateships in Medical Chemistry.  Rush also continued to fill the position of medical director of Rush Medical College and the trustees still appointed faculty and had department chairmen.  After the merger of Presbyterian Hospital and St. Luke’s Hospital in 1956, and their continued relationship with the University of Illinois, the trustees had their doubts about the possibility of ever re-opening Rush Medical College.  In 1960, James A. Campbell was named Medical Director of Rush Medical College.  Touting the need for more medical schools in Chicago, along with Rush’s fortunate location, and the possibility of raising the funds to re-establish the school, eventually Campbell was able to convince the trustees to support his plan.  In July 1969, the Board of Trustees of Rush Medical College approved a merger of Rush Medical College with Presbyterian-St. Luke’s Hospital, and the Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke’s Medical Center was established.</inm:adminbiohist>

The Corpuscle began as a mostly monthly publication by and for Rush Medical College students and included articles, news about classes, and college gossip.  In 1895, the faculty became more involved in the publication, writing articles for a wider audience of both students and practitioners on medical and surgical subjects, medical education, medical news, and the history of the college and Presbyterian Hospital.  The Corpuscle often included alumni bulletins and advertisements for local businesses.

Lake Forest University’s catalogs include lists of trustees, faculty, and students, admission and graduation requirements, courses of study, and information on facilities and expenses.

Series 6.  Deans and Presidents’ Records, 1880s-1939
About 200 items
Arrangement:  Mostly chronological
Scope Content:  Records of the Deans and Presidents of Rush Medical College include correspondence and memoranda of Edward L. Holmes, President of Rush Medical College, 1890-1898; John M. Dodson, Junior Dean, 1898-1900, and Dean of Students, 1900-1923; Ernest E. Irons, Dean of Rush Medical College, 1923-1936; and material related to committees established by the President of the University of Chicago.  Please see first folder in the series for lists of deans and presidents of Rush Medical College.  The papers of Irons include reports on medical cases and issues and financial and faculty information.  Dodson’s papers include material from a few scrapbooks he compiled.  One of the scrapbooks includes information on the Demonstrator’s Association of Illinois which distributed cadavers for clinics, 1904-1908.  Dodson was particularly interested in medical education standards and collected information about other states’ laws of licensure for medical practitioners, state requirements for medical schools, and catalogs and regulations from both American and British universities.  This scrapbook was in very poor shape and the material was removed from its binding and the brown paper of the scrapbook.  Page numbers have been lost, but material has retained original order for the most part.  Dodson’s papers also include faculty recommendations, a wide variety of clippings, and a scrapbook presented to him by the Faculty and Alumni Association of Rush Medical College, 1919, in honor of thirty years of service.  The scrapbook contains names and recollections of Dodson from Rush alumni who contributed to purchase a watch as a gift for Dodson and to develop a fund for an annual lecture in Dodson’s name.

Series 13. Relationship with Presbyterian Hospital, 1882-1941
About 20 items
Arrangement:  Chronological
Scope Content:  Presbyterian Hospital of the City of Chicago, 1883-1957, chartered 21 July 1883, was founded by faculty at Rush Medical College who wanted a hospital which could provide clinical instruction for its students.  The faculty turned to local Presbyterian leaders to provide the financial support needed to proceed with such an endeavor.  The hospital opened in September 1884.  Rush Medical College was affiliated with the University of Chicago beginning in 1898.  Eventually, Presbyterian, Rush, and the University of Chicago disagreed on the future of Rush, and the affiliation was dissolved.  In 1941, Rush Medical College was closed after the loss of the affiliation.  Soon afterwards, Presbyterian Hospital became affiliated with the University of Illinois.  The medical staff of Presbyterian Hospital served as faculty for the University of Illinois.  In an effort to combine their resources, Presbyterian Hospital merged with St. Luke’s Hospital, 25 April 1956, becoming Presbyterian-St. Luke’s Hospital.

The material in this series includes founding documents and material related to the closing of Rush Medical College.

For more information on Presbyterian Hospital, please see the Presbyterian Hospital of the City of Chicago Records, #4705.

<inm:archivistnote>Rush Medical College, 1837-1942, was founded by physician Daniel Brainard (1812-1866) and chartered 2 March 1837, two days before the city of Chicago received its own charter.  The school’s downtown location was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.  After the fire, the school was re-located to the west side of the city, where it remains to this day.  In 1887, the College became the medical department of Lake Forest University.  This relation was dissolved by mutual consent in April 1898, and in the same month an affiliation with the University of Chicago was established.  In 1883, Presbyterian Hospital was established in affiliation with Rush Medical College.  In May 1924, a new contract was executed between the Rush Medical College and the University of Chicago, and Rush became more of an integral part of the University.  In 1941, Rush Medical College and the University of Chicago terminated their relationship, and Rush became affiliated with the University of Illinois.  Rush closed its doors, and its faculty remained on the staff at the University of Illinois.  Rush’s charter remained active, and the corporation still owned its land and buildings.  In July 1969, the Board of Trustees of Rush Medical College approved a merger of Rush Medical College with Presbyterian-St. Luke’s Hospital, and the Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke’s Medical Center was established.  The records of Rush Medical College include general historical information; printed material, such as annual announcements, student publications, and catalogs; material related to students, such as registration information, course material, essays and awards, and examination and graduation material; faculty material, including faculty meeting minutes, writings by faculty, and other material; material related to the Board of Trustees, including meeting minutes and correspondence; records of some of the deans and presidents of Rush, including E. L. Holmes, John M. Dodson, and Ernest E. Irons, including correspondence, memoranda, and material related to medical education standards; records of the registrar, secretaries, comptroller, auditor, and college clerk; other financial records; records of the library and archives; material related to Rush’s relationships with Presbyterian Hospital, Lake Forest University, and the University of Chicago; legal material; and other material which has not been divided into series.
