Surgeon Nicholas Senn, 1844-1908, was born in Buchs, Switzerland, 31 October 1844. He moved to the United States as a child, when his family settled in Ashford, Wisconsin. In 1869, Senn graduated from Chicago Medical College and married Aurelia S. Millhouser (spellings vary).  Their children included sons Emanuel J. Senn, 1869-1947, Rush Medical College graduate, 1893, and William Nicholas Senn, 1876-1947, Rush graduate, 1900.  Senn died of heart disease on January 12, 1908.

Senn’s Chicago career began with his one and a half year internship at Cook County Hospital following his graduation from medical school.  He then practiced medicine in Wisconsin for five years and became an attending surgeon of Milwaukee Hospital in 1874.  In 1878, Senn attended courses at the University of Munich, Germany and earned a second medical degree.  He returned to Chicago in 1884 to serve for three years as a Professor of Surgery at the College of Physicians and Surgeons.

From 1888 until the time of his death, Senn held several positions in surgery and pathology at Rush Medical College and the University of Chicago. Senn was instrumental in raising the medical training at Rush from two to three years and requiring applicants to the college to be high school graduates.  During his time at Rush Medical College and the University of Chicago, Nicholas Senn held the following titles:

Professor of the Principles of Surgery and of Surgical Pathology, 1888-1890
Professor of Practice of Surgery and of Clinical Surgery, 1890-1898
Nicholas Senn Professor of Surgery, 1898-1905
Board of Trustees, 1895-1898
Nicholas Senn Professor and Head of the Department of Surgery, and professor of Surgery in the University of Chicago, 1905-1907
Nicholas Senn Professor of Military Surgery, and Professor of Surgery in the University of Chicago, 1907-1908

Senn became Surgeon General for both Wisconsin and Illinois in 1890.  Senn gained a reputation as a military surgeon for his experiences assisting the Greeks in the Graeco-Turkish War, and assisting Japan in the Japanese-Russian War. In 1898, he served in the Spanish-American War as Surgeon General of the Sixth Army Corps in Cuba.  Senn’s experience treating soldiers on the battlefield led him to write several papers suggesting how conditions could be improved.  His work led to innovations in army medical services.  Senn traveled the world, and wrote about his travels from a medical standpoint.

Senn was a member of several professional associations.  He was founder of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States. He also served as president of the American Surgical Association, 1892; of the Chicago Medical Society, 1894; and of the American Medical Association, 1897.

His areas of interest and research included work in abdominal surgery, plastic surgery, animal experimentation, intestine and bone diseases, microscopic diagnosis, and first aid on the battlefield.  His experience with military surgery inspired his research on gunshot wounds, including the use of hydrogen gas to determine perforation of intestines.

Senn sponsored the building of Senn Hall in 1902 which still stands on Harrison Street.  He donated most of the funds and encouraged other faculty members and trustees to contribute to its construction.</p></bioghist><controlaccess><subject>Abdomen surgery—History.
